**Narrator:** <emotion: warm, inviting> Emma took a deep breath... and stepped onto the mossy path.

**Narrator:** The forest welcomed her with the sweet scent of wildflowers, and the gentle chirping of hidden birds.

**Emma:** <emotion: curious, slightly nervous> Hello? Is anyone there?

**Narrator:** <emotion: mysterious, soft> The trees seemed to lean closer, as if listening. Then, from deep within the forest, she heard two sounds...

**Narrator:** <emotion: gentle, intriguing> To her left... a tinkling laugh, like silver bells.

**Narrator:** <emotion: warm, mysterious> To her right... a low, friendly rumble.

**Narrator:** Which sound should Emma follow?

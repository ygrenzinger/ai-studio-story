## TRANSCRIPT

**Narrator:** Emma took a deep breath... and stepped onto the mossy path. 
The forest welcomed her with the sweet scent of wildflowers, and the 
gentle chirping of hidden birds.

**Emma:** Hello? Is anyone there?

**Narrator:** The trees seemed to lean closer, as if listening. Then, from 
deep within the forest, she heard two sounds...

To her left... a tinkling laugh, like silver bells.

To her right... a low, friendly rumble.

Which sound should Emma follow?
